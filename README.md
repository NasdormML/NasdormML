## 🏆 **Key Projects:**

### [📊 Store Sales Forecasting (Top 450 on Kaggle)](https://github.com/NasdormML/Time_Series)
Time series forecasting for retail store sales using XGBoost and custom feature engineering (lags, moving averages). Optimized with Optuna, achieving an RMSLE score of **0.75094**, placing me in the **top 450** on Kaggle.

- **Tech stack:** Python, XGBoost, Optuna, TimeSeriesSplit
- **Goal:** Improve sales planning and inventory management for retailers.

### [🏠 House Price Prediction](https://github.com/NasdormML/House_price_try)
Developed a regression model to predict housing prices using XGBoost. Conducted detailed EDA and optimized hyperparameters, reducing RMSE by **10%** through RandomizedSearchCV.

- **Tech stack:** Python, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Pandas
- **Goal:** Assist realtors and banks in making more accurate property valuations.

## 🤔 **What’s Next?**

I'm currently focused on building a recommendation system based on the **MovieLens 100k dataset** using collaborative filtering techniques. In the near future, I plan to:
- Transition into **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** and work on projects that involve sentiment analysis, text classification, and language models.
- Apply cutting-edge NLP models such as transformers to solve complex language-based problems.
